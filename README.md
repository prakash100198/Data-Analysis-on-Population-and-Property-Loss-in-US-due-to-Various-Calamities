Synopsis  
In this report we will look at the infliction of various calamities on population and economic(property+crop) damage over the years from 1950 to 2011. Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.  
  
The question we are interested in answering are as follows:  
  
Across the United States, which types of events(EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?  
  
Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
